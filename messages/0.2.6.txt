Changes in 0.2.6
================

## Fixes
    - Rustfmt integration is not as good as I would like, big changes regarding
      it are gonna come in next releases with the addition of a new custom crate
      that wraps rustfmt and make anaconda able to call Rust code directly from
      Python, in the meanwhile I switch to write mode `Plain` and recommend
      `rustfmt` 0.5.0 in the README file, this will hopefully solve:
      	* #15: Ignore children modules when formatting
      	* #16: Auto format adds one empty line in the beginning of the file
      	* #17: Auto-format sometimes deletes code
