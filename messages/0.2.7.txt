Changes in 0.2.7
================

## Fixes
    - For some strange reason, rustfmt adds a log like 'Using rustfmt config
      file (file_path) to the header of its output even if the configured
      writer is Plain or Display, we just remove that line from the output if
      we find it when we run rustfmt.
