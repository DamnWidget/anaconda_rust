Changes in 0.2.2
================

## Features
        - Added `rust_rustfmt_config_path` option that can be used to pass the
          path to a `rustfmt.toml` configuration file.
        - Now rustfmt uses the current project path as config path for default or
          the directory where the file being edited is contained if a project is
          not present
